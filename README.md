# Popcorn time instalation for ARMv7 (Odroid-U3|Ubuntu 14.04.2)

This is an experimental build for Odroid-U3. I never tried on other devices, so I would really appreciate feedback!
Some videos/audios can't be decoded yet due to lack of codecs on nwjs. 

### Instalation guide
  - Download files:
     - Popcorn-Time.tar.gz
     - pt_installer.sh
  - (optional) Move downloaded files to the same folder
  - Run pt_installer.sh from terminal with sudo privileges
  - Run Popcorn Time 
  - Eat popcorn!

### Uninstalation guide - How to uninstall Popcorn Time ?
  - Main application:
    - Delete ~/.Popcorn-Time
    - Delete ~/.local/share/applications/Popcorn-Time.desktop

  - Configuration files and databases:
    - Delete ~/.config/Popcorn-Time
